#### NOTE: 
I don't use any 3rd part plugin manager (pathen or vim-plug) anymore. Only use vim8+ built-in package management systerm.
#### Where: 
  `~/.vim`
#### Where config:
  `~/.vim/my_configs.vim`

#### How to install/update plugins
Just 
  `git clone https://repo_url/blah.git ~/.vim/pack/myplugins/start/blah`

Or put the `name repo_git_url` as a line as in the `~/.vim/update_plugins.py`, then run
`python update_plugins.py` and it's updates all of them. 

The `update_plugins.py` (customized with my own folders)  and the files in `~/.vim/vimrcs/` were from `https://github.com/amix/vimrc`.  

#### ~/.vimrc

```
 " DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
 " Add your own customizations in ~/.vim_runtime/my_configs.vim
 
 set runtimepath+=~/.vim
 
 source ~/.vim/vimrcs/basic.vim
 source ~/.vim/vimrcs/filetypes.vim
 source ~/.vim/vimrcs/plugins_config.vim
 source ~/.vim/vimrcs/extended.vim
 try
   source ~/.vim/my_configs.vim
 catch
 endtry
```
If for base vim use: just 
`cat ~/.vim/vimrcs/basic.vim > ~/.vimrc`

For all customozations including plugin configurations, code should go to,
`~/.vim/my_configs.vim`

#### Other directories
`backupdir`, `temp_dirs`(? in use) should be created manually. 

#### dot.vimrc
Just for being used as a template for `~/.vimrc`
